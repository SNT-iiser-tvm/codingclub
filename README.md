# Coding Club — IISER Thiruvananthapuram

The club website. Plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript with **no build step** — what is in
the repo is what gets served. Open `index.html` in a browser and it works.

Live at <https://sites.iisertvm.ac.in/codingclub/> — the institute reverse-proxies
that path to GitHub Pages. `codingclub.iisertvm.ac.in` has no DNS record; it is not
a working address. See "How it is served" below.

---

## Running it locally

```bash
npm install     # only needed for the dev server
npm run dev     # browser-sync on :3000, reloads on save
```

If you move a file, **check the `--files` globs in `package.json`**. They are literal
paths, so `*.css` matches only the repository root — a stylesheet under `assets/css/`
will not trigger a reload unless the glob names it. A stale watch list looks exactly
like a broken feature: the browser keeps running the previous script.

`npm start` serves the same files without live reload. Neither is required to work on
the site — any static file server, or opening the HTML directly, will do.

---

## How it is served

The site is **not** hosted on the institute's server. It is on GitHub Pages, and
Apache on `sites.iisertvm.ac.in` reverse-proxies one path to it:

```
https://sites.iisertvm.ac.in/codingclub/
        └─ Apache 2.4.52 (Ubuntu) ──► https://coding-club-of-iiser-thiruvananthapuram.github.io/codingclub/
```

Measured with curl and a headless browser, that proxy does three things to the
response, and each one costs us something:

1. **Only the index is mapped.** `/codingclub/` returns the page; `/codingclub/team.html`,
   `/codingclub/index.html`, every stylesheet, script and image returns GitHub's 404
   page. The live site today loads its HTML and *nothing else* — no CSS, no navbar
   script, broken logos, and every link in the menu dead. The mapping behaves like a
   single-URL `ProxyPass` to `…/codingclub/index.html` rather than a subtree mount.
2. **It injects `<base href="https://sites.iisertvm.ac.in/codingclub/">`** as the first
   thing inside `<head>`, on every response including 404s. The URL is constant, so it
   is *wrong for any page not at the site root*: on `members/foo.html`, `../assets/css/console.css`
   resolves to `/assets/css/console.css` — above the site — and 404s. A `<base>` of our
   own cannot fix this: the first `<base>` in the document wins and theirs is inserted
   ahead of ours.
3. **It rewrites every `src="…"`** to an absolute URL under `/codingclub/`, including
   inside inline `<script>` strings. `href` is left alone. For a root page this is a
   no-op; for a subdirectory page it turns `../assets/x.png` into `/assets/x.png`.

Verified against a local simulation of all three rules: **root pages come through
perfectly (0 failed requests); `members/*` and `others/*` lose their stylesheet, their
script and their images.**

Two smaller things: `https://sites.iisertvm.ac.in/codingclub` without the trailing
slash 301-redirects to **`http://`**, dropping TLS, and `codingclub.iisertvm.ac.in`
(which this README used to advertise) has no DNS record at all.


### How dead calls to server is fixed

The proxy blocks paths *under* `/codingclub/`. It does not stop the browser from talking
to GitHub Pages directly, and GitHub Pages sends neither `X-Frame-Options` nor a CSP
`frame-ancestors`. So `index.html` — the one document the proxy does serve — hides itself
and hands the whole viewport to the real site in a full-bleed iframe, but *only* when
`location.hostname` is exactly `sites.iisertvm.ac.in`. It names the one host that needs
this rather than listing the hosts that do not: the dev server is reached by LAN IP from
a phone as often as by `localhost`, and an allow-list got that wrong — the phone framed
the deployed site instead of the local one.

The result: `sites.iisertvm.ac.in/codingclub/` stays the address in the bar, and every
page, stylesheet, script and image inside it is fetched from GitHub Pages, where the
relative paths this repo is built on work normally. Subdirectory pages are fine again —
they are never requested through the proxy.

`?p=` deep-links into it: `…/codingclub/?p=team.html`, `…/codingclub/?p=members/antrin.html`.
The value is validated as a relative path — an absolute URL, a `javascript:` URL or any
`..` falls back to the home page, so the parameter cannot be used to frame another site.

The block is the commented `<script>` in the `<head>` of `index.html`, about fifteen
lines. It does nothing on GitHub Pages or on the dev server. Delete it the day the
proxy config is fixed.

**This only works once the site is actually deployed.** GitHub Pages is currently serving
the version from 5 October 2025; the redesign is unpushed local work.

## How a page is put together

Every page is the same three things:

```html
<link href="assets/css/console.css" rel="stylesheet">
...
<div class="deck" data-deck data-page="team.html" data-title="Roster">
  <div class="screen" data-screen>
    <div class="glass" aria-hidden="true"></div>
    <!-- page content -->
  </div>
</div>
<script src="assets/js/console.js"></script>
```

- **`.deck`** is the instrument housing: a fixed bezel holding four grid rows —
  title rail, menu bar, screen, status rail.
- **`.screen`** is the only thing that scrolls. `html` and `body` have
  `overflow: hidden`.
- **`data-page`** tells the menu bar which item to mark as current. It is the
  filename of the nav entry, so member pages pass `team.html`.
- **`data-title`** is the label the status rail starts with.
- **`data-up`** is how far the page sits below the site root — `"../"` for anything
  in `members/` or `others/`, omitted at the root. `console.js` prefixes every link
  it injects with it.

`console.js` injects the title rail, menu bar and status rail into every page that
has `[data-deck]`, so the chrome lives in one place. The grid rows are pinned in CSS
(`grid-row: 1..4`), so nothing shifts while that runs.

**To add or rename a nav item, edit the `NAV` array at the top of
`assets/js/console.js`.** Each entry is `[label, file, icon]`; the icon is a Font
Awesome name. `data-up` handles subdirectory paths.

Each entry ends with an **active** flag. `false` leaves the item out of the menu on
every page but keeps the page itself reachable by URL — that is how `/merch` is
parked while the shop has nothing real to sell.

The phone menu picks its layout from the active count, in `console.js`, by setting
`data-nav-rows` on `<html>`: up to seven switches sit in one row (auto-flow columns,
so the count is never hard-coded), eight or more go two rows of four with `--nav`
doubled to 88px. Both live in the PHONE block of `console.css`. Nine or more would
open a third row inside the same height — raise `--nav` with it.

### Components in `console.css`

| Class | Use |
|---|---|
| `.wrap` | Centred content column, max 1180px |
| `.sec` / `.sec__title` | A titled section, one per panel |
| `.divider` + `.lbl` | The engraved "Panel A · Navigation" label |
| `.manifest` / `.manifest__row` | List rows: date, name, description, status |
| `.spec` / `.spec__row` | Two-column specification list |
| `.areas` / `.area` | Icon panel for focus areas |
| `.creed` | The club motto set as a section divider |
| `.roster` / `.person` | People grid |
| `.tabs` / `.tabs__btn` | Roster selector on team.html |
| `.empty` | Panel with no data wired to it yet |
| `.check` / `.check__q` | Accordion (FAQ) |
| `.comms` / `.card` / `.field` | Contact and detail panels |
| `.term` | Terminal readout |
| `.shop` / `.vf` | Merch catalogue and viewfinder stage |
| `.btn`, `.chip`, `.tag`, `.state` | Buttons and small labels |
| `.gauge` + `.rail__pct` | Segmented scroll gauge in the status rail |
| `.manifest__n` | Row index on the mission-log spine |

### Instrumentation

Three things carry the flight-deck idea into the content rather than leaving it on the
frame. All are in the `INSTRUMENTATION` block at the end of `console.css`.

- **Scroll gauge.** Sixteen segments plus a percentage in the status rail, on every
  page. It measures *travel* — a page shorter than the screen reads 100%.
- **Mission log.** `.manifest` rows hang off a vertical spine with a tick and an index
  per row, so lists read as a plotted log instead of a table.
The screen grid is drafting film: a minor rule every 56px and a major one every 224px.

The home page carries no stat boxes — the terminal already reports members, projects,
courses and posts, so repeating them was duplication. The club motto sits there
instead, set in italic between double hairlines as a section divider.

### The post reader

Clicking a post on `blogs.html` opens it in a modal styled like the rest of the site,
instead of navigating to `Blogs/Posts/*.html`, which share none of this design. The
article is **fetched from its own file** and its `.leftcolumn` lifted out, so the posts
remain the single source of truth and nothing is duplicated.

Four things it has to keep doing:

- **The links keep a real `href`.** The handler only calls `preventDefault` on a plain
  left click, so middle-click, ⌘/Ctrl-click and no-JS all navigate to the post as
  before.
- **Relative URLs are rebased.** A post lives in `Blogs/Posts/`, so `../Media/x.png`
  has to resolve against *that* file, not against the page hosting the modal.
- **Both `src` and `data-src` are handled.** Joshy's post lazy-loads through `data-src`
  and its own script, which the reader strips — matching only `img[src]` left that
  post showing twenty empty frames.
- **A failed fetch offers the real page** rather than an empty panel.

`.prose` restyles the fetched markup into this site's type, and neutralises the source
pages' own `.card`, `.rightcolumn` and `.more-blogs` wrappers.

### Typed readouts

Any element with `data-type` types its own text out on load, dock-display style,
with a caret parked at the end. Three rules it follows, and any new use must too:

- **The text lives in the markup.** The script reads it, clears it, then types it
  back. With JS off or broken the full sentence is simply there — verified by
  rendering with the script tag removed.
- **The rendered height is reserved before clearing**, or the panel below jumps up
  as the sentence grows from nothing to two lines. Measured: 0px shift.
- **A `setTimeout` forces the final text** in case the timers stall in a background
  tab, the same guarantee the readout figures used to need.

### Motion

The deck powers up rather than appearing: the top rail drops in, the switches in the
menu light up left to right, the screen rises behind them, and the bottom rail comes up
last — about 500ms end to end. Clicking an internal link fades the deck out over 150ms
first, so the next page's entrance continues the movement instead of cutting to it.
Sections below the fold rise as they reach the screen.

Three rules the `MOTION` block at the end of `console.css` follows, and any addition
must too:

- **Nothing may hide content.** Entrance animations run `both` from a *visible* end
  state, so a page whose animation never runs is simply all there. The scroll reveal is
  applied by `console.js`, never written into the markup, and only to sections that are
  below the fold at load — what you are looking at is never hidden, not for a frame.
  Measured after scrolling every page: 0 sections left invisible while in view.
- **Opacity and transform only.** No layout property is animated. Measured cumulative
  layout shift during load: 0.00003.
- **`prefers-reduced-motion` turns all of it off**, including the reveal's starting
  state — verified with the media feature emulated: nothing hidden, terminal written out
  in full immediately.

The scroll reveal rides the throttled `place()` handler the status rail already runs, so
it costs no extra listener and no IntersectionObserver.

### Design tokens

All colour and type lives in `:root` at the top of `console.css`. The palette is
derived from the club logo, which is a fully-saturated ramp from `#1400f0` (hue 244)
through `#7800dc` to `#a000c8` (hue 288); the tokens are lightened versions of those
hues so they stay legible on black.

Grids draw their hairlines with `outline` on the cells, **not** with a background
colour on the container. A container background shows through any unfilled cell in
the last row as a large pale block.

## hangar.html — passion projects

The intake form is a Tally form (`https://tally.so/r/jajx1R`), owned by the club
account, opened in a new tab from the callout. It branches on what is being proposed
— a project, a talk, an event, or something else — and is written for first-years:
no jargon, every open question shows what "enough" looks like, and it asks for
comfort level and available time so a newcomer can be paired with the right people.

The header image is `assets/img/brand/passion-projects-cover.png`, which Tally loads
from GitHub Pages at render time — so it only shows once that file is deployed.

The form was built through Tally's API. Two things that cost an hour to learn:

- `CHECKBOX` blocks take `groupType: "CHECKBOXES"`, not `"CHECKBOX"`.
- Publishing with a status-only `PATCH` leaves the draft blocks uncompiled: the form
  reports zero questions and the public URL returns 500. Resend the blocks with the
  status change and it works.

The active-projects list used to sit at the foot of `events.html`, where nobody saw
the form. Both now live here, form first.

## newsletter.html — how the issue is served

The newsletter is a 26 MB A3/A4 print PDF. It is not the viewer, and it cannot be:
an `<embed>` of a PDF renders blank inside an iframe on iOS, which is exactly the
situation this site is in when it is reached through the institute proxy.

So the issue is **pre-rendered once, offline**, and the site serves images:

```bash
pdftoppm -r 150 -png ccit_newsletter1.pdf sheet          # 16 sheets
magick sheet-NN.png -crop 50%x100% +repage half-NN-%d.png # the A3 ones
magick <page> -resize 1240x -quality 80 full/pNN.webp
magick <page> -resize 560x  -quality 72 thumb/pNN.webp
```

Sheet 1 and sheet 16 are A4 portrait; sheets 2–15 are **A3 landscape spreads that
each carry two numbered pages**. Cutting them at the fold is not a compromise — it
is the pagination the designer already used, and the footers confirm it. The result
is thirty portrait pages, one printed page each, so a phone never has to show two
side by side and the desktop and the phone load the same files.

Three things the reader has to keep doing:

- **Zoom is a toggle, not a nicety.** A dense A3 half fitted to a 390px screen is a
  picture of an article, not a readable one. Fit sizes against the viewport; zoom
  pins the image to its rendered 1240px and lets the body scroll in both axes.

  **Both open fitted, phone included.** Opening the phone zoomed was tried and is
  wrong: 1240px on a 412px screen is 3x, so the reader lands on the top-left corner
  and every page looks broken because you never see a whole one. Show the page,
  then let zoom be the deliberate step.
- **The contact sheet is built by the script, not written out.** Without JS the
  tiles would be thirty buttons that cannot open anything, so the markup offers the
  PDF in a `<noscript>` instead.
- **A piece opened from the contents list stays inside that piece.** The reader
  always works within a range. From the cover or the contact sheet that range is
  the whole issue; from a contents row it is only that piece's pages, so the
  arrows, the keyboard and a swipe all stop at its last page instead of carrying
  you into the next article. Scoped, the caption leads with the piece and counts
  within it (`GlassWorm malware · 01 / 02`) — `08 / 30` there would name a page
  the arrows cannot reach.
- **The span lives in the markup, as `data-open-page`.** `"8"` means the whole
  issue opened at page 8; `"8-9"` means those two pages and nothing else. A
  one-page piece is written `"14-14"`, not `"14"` — without the dash it would open
  the whole issue. Two pieces can share a sheet (pages 16 and 17 each carry two),
  so the scoped title is taken from the row's own `.manifest__name` rather than
  from the per-page `names` map, which only knows what is printed on the page.
- **`#p8` opens the reader on page 8, `#p8-9` opens that piece.** Unscoped, the
  hash follows the page you turn to through `replaceState` — the same idiom the
  roster tabs use, so the back button still points at wherever you came from
  rather than at every page turn. Scoped, it names the range and stays put: the
  piece, not the page, is the thing worth linking to.

The page list and the per-page captions live in `window.NEWSLETTER` at the foot of
`newsletter.html`, not in `console.js`: it is content, it changes once an edition,
and no other page has any use for it. `console.js` skips the whole reader block on
every other page with one property lookup.

**To publish the next edition:** render it the same way into
`assets/img/newsletter/`, put the PDF in `assets/docs/`, and update `window.NEWSLETTER`
and the contents rows — each row's `data-open-page` span and its `Pages n–m` label
have to agree, and nothing checks that for you. Nothing in the stylesheet or the
shared script needs to change.

## worker/ — the merch backend, dormant

`worker/` is a dormant backend layer for the merch: it has a Cloudflare Worker with D1,
R2, Razorpay settlement, a Resend confirmation mail and an in-worker QR generator, plus
its schema, seeds, smoke script and tests. **Nothing on this site talks to it.** The
merch page is entirely client-side; the copy is here so the shop can be wired up later
without starting from scratch.

Three things to know before anyone switches it on:

- `wrangler.jsonc` names D1 database id, R2 bucket and allowed origins.
  Those are that account's resources;
- `DIRECT_PAY: "1"` is set, which makes `POST /api/pay` mark any order paid with no
  gateway involved. That is deliberate there and dangerous here — remove it before the
  Worker is ever deployed on a domain that takes money.
- Secrets are not in the repo. `.dev.vars.example` is a template; the real file is
  git-ignored, and the local D1/R2 state and order backups that came with the copy were
  deleted rather than committed — they held real names, emails and phone numbers.


## Weight

Nothing here is minified and nothing needs to be, but four things were large enough to
matter and were dealt with directly:

- **Course slides: 44 MB → 10 MB.** Each `assets/course/*.svg` is vector art wrapped
  around a handful of base64 rasters, and the same 1.2 MB background JPEG was embedded
  in all sixteen. The rasters are now capped at 1400px and re-encoded — JPEG where
  there is no alpha channel, PNG where there is, so the slides that use a grayscale
  mask still composite correctly. The vector text is untouched and still sharp.
- **Portraits: 4.3 MB → 568 KB.** Four photographs were 2400–3100px on the long edge
  and were being drawn into 220px tiles.
- **Plotly: 3.4 MB → 1.0/1.6 MB.** `plotly-latest.min.js` is a frozen 1.58.5 alias.
  `dbscan.html` draws scatter only, so it loads the *basic* bundle;
  `linear_regression.html` needs `surface` and `scatter3d`, so it loads *gl3d*. Both
  pinned to 3.0.1.
- **`node_modules/` is no longer tracked** (`git rm -r --cached`); `.gitignore` covers
  it. The files stay on disk for the dev server.

- **Newsletter: 26 MB of PDF → 8.4 MB of pages.** The issue is rendered once to WebP
  at 150 DPI, in two sizes: 1240px for the reader and 560px for the contact sheet.
  The PDF stays in `assets/docs/` as the download.

If you replace a photograph, check its pixel size before committing it. Nothing in the
site displays an image wider than about 800px — the newsletter pages are the exception,
and deliberately so: they are a document, and zooming into one is the point.

## Checking a change

`console.css` and `console.js` are single files whose blocks sit directly next to each
other, so deleting a range by its start and end markers can take a neighbouring block
with it. This has bitten twice: removing the dead `.modules` CSS also deleted the
roster and slide-viewer rules, and removing the dead count-up script also deleted the
roster tabs. Balanced braces, a clean parse and a 200 response all still pass — none
of them can see a behaviour that is simply gone.

Run the checker before calling a change done:

```bash
python3 tools-check.py
```

It verifies that every class the markup uses is still defined in the stylesheet, that
every interactive hook (`tabs__btn`, `check__q`, `data-term`, `data-gauge`, …) is still
referenced by the script, that tab buttons and tab panels pair up, and that every
manifest row has its index cell.

Two gotchas it exists because of:

- `grep -c 'manifest__n'` also matches `manifest__name`. Include the closing quote.
- A Python `str.replace` whose pattern does not match is a silent no-op. Assert on the
  match count when patching, and read the file back.

## Conventions

- Two-space indent in CSS and JS, four in HTML.
- No frameworks. No build step. If something needs a dependency, question it first.
- Asset paths are written relative to the page. Pages in `members/` and `others/`
  prefix `../` and declare `data-up="../"`.
- Content is edited directly in the HTML. There is no CMS and no templating.
